Summary of repository structure
The top‑level repo directory holds the GTI system’s Python modules (gti_pipeline.py, data_ingestion.py, etc.), a config.py or YAML/JSON file where current configuration options (like data sources and thresholds) are defined, and a history directory holding cached phase‑gap history.

There are other files for building slides, but the app’s logic lives under repo/.

NTP is not currently referenced; the GTI pipeline ingests BIPM/TAI/GNSS data, computes phase gaps between atomic timescales and a modeled reference, then extrapolates an ETA when the gap will converge to zero.

Proposed mesh‑network NTP module
A simple NTP‑based mesh network can detect global timing anomalies by repeatedly measuring differences between the local clock and its peers. Each node would:

Periodically send “ping” requests to a list of peer nodes (using the Network Time Protocol).

Record the round‑trip delay and offset estimates for each peer.

Compute a local “mesh‑phase gap” as the median of offsets minus a baseline (e.g., average offset over the past 24 hours).

Use the same slope‑based ETA formula as the GTI pipeline: eta = |phase_gap| / |slope|, where the slope is the rate of change of the mesh‑phase gap (negative slopes indicate convergence).

Expose the mesh data via an API endpoint /api/mesh_status, returning JSON similar to the existing /api/forecast.

Integration plan
Add new configuration flag in config.py, e.g., USE_MESH_MONITOR = False. When True, the backend should run the mesh monitor in parallel with the GTI pipeline.

Extend the API with /api/mesh_status returning:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "phase_gap": ...,
  "slope": ...,
  "eta_days": ...,
  "timestamp": "..."
}
Expose toggle in the UI so users can select “Mesh only,” “GTI only,” or “Combined.” If combined, display both ETAs and highlight agreement or divergence.

Persist mesh history analogous to phase_gap_history.json, enabling robust statistics and stability checks similar to robust_eta_from_history.

Add a mesh‑monitor runner that polls NTP peers and publishes updates to the web front‑end. This runner can be scheduled via a background thread or task queue.

Expected benefit
A mesh NTP network provides a decentralized check on global timing. If the GTI’s astrophysical phase gap predicts a timeline collision and the mesh monitor shows increasing local clock skew across many nodes, confidence in an impending “0000 reset” grows. Conversely, if the mesh remains stable while GTI suggests convergence, the anomaly may be astrophysical rather than a global synchrony event. By modularizing the mesh monitor, the application can operate with or without the GTI system, giving flexibility for experimentation and independent verification.

This proposal outlines how to add the new module and toggle. Implementing it will require editing repository files (config.py, main.py, and API routes) and ensuring security for mesh peer lists.
